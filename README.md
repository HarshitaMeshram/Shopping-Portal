Shopping Portal

CHAPTER: 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Overview 
This project is a web based service booking system for house doorstep. The 
central concept of the application is to allow the customer to book services 
virtually using the Internet. Online shopping or e-commerce is the fastest 
gaining ground meaning it has become more popular for business. More and 
more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for 
performing business over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of 
shopping on the web is becoming commonplace. Online household services is a 
form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods 
from a seller over the internet using a web browser. It is a business to consumer 
e-commerce. Online customers must have access to the Internet. The WEB 
BASED ONLINE HOUSEHOLD SERVICES PROVIDING WEBSITE project 
focuses on basic operations like adding new product, new member and updating 
new information, searching of products etc. 
This system has three main modules. 
  Insertion to database module -user friendly input screen  
  Extracting from database module-Attractive output screen  
  Search facility system –search for items 
1.2 Problem Definition 
The Problems are: 
 It is manual and time consuming. 
 The service provider are not well experienced. 
 The customer were not satisfied with the company.

1.1 Overview of Report 
2 Our project “Household Services website” aims to book Services needed at all 
the fare price. 
3 The aim of our project is to develop a system that is meant to partially 
computerize the work performed in the online Household services portal to 
order goods.  
4 We used Html and CSS along with JS and bootstraps as front end and PHP, PHP 
FRAMEWORK and MySQL as back end for developing our project. Software 
we used for front end and back end is Sublime Text Editor. Sublime Text is a 
share-ware cross-platform source code editor with a Python application 
programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming 
languages and MARKUP languages. We can create an application by designing 
the form and that makes the user interface. Adding the codes to the form and the 
objects such as buttons and text boxes on them and adding any required support 
code of additional modular. PHP is the most popular scripting language for web 
development. It is free, open source and server-side (the code is executed on the 
server). MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that 
uses Structured Query Language (SQL). It is also free and open source. MySQL 
is a database system used on the web. MySQL is a database system that runs on 
a server. MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications. MySQL is very 
fast, reliable, and easy to use. MySQL uses standard SQL.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Introduction  
Systems are designed keeping in mind an issue that is to be solved. Every system 
is designed in its unique keeping in mind the requirement of the problem or the 
issue. Our system solves the problem of searching for the good that the 
customer’s needs. 
System design involves the design of overall architecture, based on which we 
design components, modules and interfaces. The beginning of any system 
architecture is by decomposing it into smaller fragments. Decomposition and 
binding of components makes the architecture easy to understand and makes it 
easier to understand.  
Our system uses algorithm for collecting data which will collect the data of user 
and we have data analysing algorithm which will analyse and highlight the needs 
of user. 
3.2 Architectural Diagram 
Given below is the architectural diagram, which shows that user or admin needs 
to register/login. In Online household services there will be four modules i.e., 
Booking Cart, Payment, Product details and register/login as well as two sub- 
modules i.e., User and Admin, all the data will be stored in the database.  Given 
below is architectural diagram. 
5 
Fig 3.1 Architectural Diagram  
3.3 Flow Diagram  
Flow diagram is a graphic representation of the physical route or flow of people, 
materials, paper works, vehicles, or communication associated with a process, 
procedure plan, or investigation. In the second definition the meaning is limited 
to the representation of the physical route or flow. 
Here the user ask permission to login and after login the user can search or view 
product, and the products to cart as well as view the items in cart and proceed 
to payment and confirm their order. Given below is the flow diagram of User. 
6 
Fig 3.2 Flow Diagram for User 
Now we have flow diagram of admin where admin request to login and after 
getting the response the admin can add the product, Edit Product, Delete Product, 
Produce the list of products and see the order List. Given below is the flow 
diagram for admin 
Fig 3.3 Flow Diagram for Admin 
3.5 Working Principle 
Online Household Services is a web application which is used for booking 
services the main goal of our web application is to provide an easy way of 
services in doorstep. 
These web application contains many pages in home page where we have 
provided the user with various sections for the user to use it easily. 
There is also a section in the webpage where user can contact us through the 
information provided at the bottom of the home page. The user can select the 
goods they want and add them in there cart after that the user can select the cart 
in which all the selected good by the user will be stored and they can select the 
quantity of the of good like how much they want to buy and after that they need 
to log in to their account else they won’t be able to book services. After they 
have logged in to their account they can proceed to book the services and enter 
the delivery address where the services provider will reach. After that they can 
choose the payment method. After that order is placed the Admin will proceed 
with their order as soon as possible.

CHAPTER: 4 
THEORETICAL ANALYSIS 
4.1 Introduction to Tools used in Project 
4.1.1 Introduction of Html 
Hyper-Text Mark-up Language (HTML) is a simple mark-up system used to 
create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. 
HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are 
appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications. 
HTML mark-up can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and 
hypermedia; menus of options; database query results; simple structured 
documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of existing bodies of 
information. 
Advantages of Html 
1 It is widely used. 
2 Every browser supports HTML language. 
3 Easy to learn and use. 
4 It is by default in every windows so we don’t need to purchase extra software. 
4.1.2 Introduction of CSS  
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed 
language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables 
you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. 
Advantages of CSS 
1. Greater consistency in design. 
2. Ease of presenting different styles to different viewers. 
Friendly Environment 
Creating a form, adding controls to form and writing code behind the form are 
all managed within a friendly Environment. 
8 
9 
 
For Example: 
This is a sample code of html which is used to make a login form . 
          <!DOCTYPE html> 
           <html> 
           <head> 
<title>sample </title> 
</head> 
<body> 
 
<input type="text" placeholder="Email" name="email" id="type"> 
 
<input type="password"placeholder="*****" name="password" id="type"> 
 
<td align="center"><input type="submit" value="Login" name="submit" 
id="btn"> 
</body> 
</html> 
 
After this inside the body if we insert the code of CSS inside the head with 
<style> tag like : 
 <style> 
  table 
  { 
   background-color: black; 
   border: 8px solid white; 
   border-radius: 25px; 
   background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7); 
10 
 
  } 
                         #type 
  { 
   width: 300px; 
   height: 32px; 
               border:0; 
                                          outline: 0; 
                                          background:transparent; 
                     border-bottom: 3px solid white; 
                     color: white;  
          font-size: 25px; 
  } 
 
  input:: -webkit-input-placeholder 
  { 
   font-size: 20px; 
   line-height: 3; 
   color: white; 
  } 
 
  #btn 
  {      
   width:250px; 
   background-color: orange; 
   height: 35px; 
   font-size: 20px; 
  } 
</style> 
4.1.3 About PHP: 
PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor is a widely used, general-purpose scripting 
language that was originally designed for web development to produce dynamic 
web pages. For this purpose, PHP code is embedded into the HTML source code 
and can be interpreted but a web server with PHP processor module, which helps 
to generate web page document. PHP is a general-purpose scripting language 
that is especially suited to server-side web development where PHP generally 
runs on a web server. It can also be used for command line scripting and client- 
side GUI application. Many operating system and platforms, can be used with 
many relational database management systems. It is also free of charge. 
4.1.4 PHP Syntax: 
HTML, the PHP code is enclosed within <? Php ?> Tags. 
For example: 
<html> 
<head> 
<title>php sample</title> 
<body 
<h2>Hello</h2> 
<?php 
echo “hello”; 
?> 
</body> 
</html> 
In the above example PHP code is embedded within HTML. In this way the 
PHP and HTML coding is combined on the same page. 
11 
4.1.5 Working with PHP: 
When a client requests web page containing PHP code from the server, then the 
requested PHP pages are passed under PHP environment and interaction with 
database is made if required. After server side processing, the resulting HTML 
pages are passed to client and displayed on the browser. In this way the working 
of PHP is complete. 
Fig 4.1. Working In PHP 
4.1.6 Connecting PHP Application with MySQL Database 
 Make a connection variable with the database: 
$conn = mysql_connect(“localhost”,“servername”,“password”); 
Here $conn is a connection variable to database. 
 Select a database over that connection variable: 
$db=mysqli_select_db(“databasename” ,“$conn”); 
 Prepare a sql query to execute: 
$query = Select * from databasename; 
 Run the sql query: 
12 
$result = mysqli_query ($query); 
 Iterate over the result: 
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result) 
{ 
//statements 
} 
4.1.7 Introduction to MySQL: 
MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that runs as a 
server providing multi-user access to a number of databases. MySQL is 
pronounced (“My  S-Q-L”) 
MySQL development project has made its source available under the terms 
of General Public License. MySQL is owned and sponsored by a single for 
profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Sun Microsystem, 
a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation. 
MySQL works on many different system platforms including AIX, BSD i, 
FreeBSD, HP-UX, i5/OS, Linux, Mac OS X, Net BSD, Novell NetWare, Open 
BSD, Open Solaris, e com Station , OS/2 Wrap, QNX, IRIX, Solaris, Symbian, 
SunOS, SCO Open Server, SCO Unix Ware, Sanos, Tru64 and Microsoft 
Windows. A port of MySQL to Open VMS also exits. All major programming 
languages with language-specific APIs include Libraries for accessing MySQL 
database. In addition, an ODBC interface called MYODBC allows additional 
programming languages that supports the ODBC interface to communicate with 
a MySQL database, such as ASP or ColdFusion. MySQL server and official 
libraries are mostly implemented in ANSI C/ ANCI C++. 
4.1.8 Introduction to APACHE SERVER 
In this project apache server is user to parse and execute PHP pages, before 
deploying websites on the server, the website should be tested at the developer’s 
side to get a feel of how the website will work on actual server. Therefore apache 
server is like a local server on the developer side, apache server should be 
13 
informed about the environment on which it should work. In our project apache 
server is configured to work with PHP, in this way all the PHP pages are parsed 
and executed by the server.
